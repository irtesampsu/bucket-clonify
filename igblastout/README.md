### About this directory

This directory contains a folder named `clonify_data` in which there are two subfolders for FASTA and TSV files. FASTA files were downloaded from [clonify-scirep2016data](https://github.com/briney/clonify-scirep2016data) repository. On the other hand, TSV files were generated using publicly available online [IgBlast](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/igblast.cgi) tool **[Ig Sequence Analyses]**, for given FASTA files, with default parameter values. Also note that `1k_per_donor` subfolder contains data files for *1000* sequences from a certain donor, whereas `7k_per_donor` subfolder contains the same for *7000* sequences from a certain donor.
